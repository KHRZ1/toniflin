# ToniFlin

**ToniFlin** is an Android-based application designed to calculate and adjust ingredient levels in parenteral formulations to achieve isotonicity.  
It implements the **cryoscopic method**, allowing users to correct hypertonic or hypotonic solutions quickly and accurately.  
This software provides a simple and accessible tool for pharmaceutical education, training, and research purposes.

## Statement of Need

Accurate isotonicity adjustment is a fundamental aspect of parenteral formulation design, yet the necessary calculations are often time-consuming and error-prone when done manually.
ToniFlin provides a practical digital implementation of the cryoscopic method, simplifying isotonicity computation while maintaining precision, accessibility, and educational value.
